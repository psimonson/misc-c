## Miscellaneous one file C programs

This is the start of my miscellaneous one-file C programs. Starting this project
with some small examples to make brute forcing algorithms and XOR encryption. But
I will be adding much more in do time. For now just these are here. More to come...

### Code Listing

 - break.c - Simple XOR encryption scheme with brute force cracker. (has a bug)
 - crypt.c - Simple XOR encryption scheme.
 - crack.c - Simple brute force algorithm for plain text passwords.
 - pass.c  - Better brute force algorithm (it also tries subpasswords).

### Notes

 - Use whatever is in this directory how ever you want to.
 - Please leave me in the comments as a contributer if you use my code in your project.
 - If you find a bug that I don't know about please report it and I'll try to track it down and fix it when I can.
 - My e-mail address is psimonson1988@gmail.com, please NO spam. ONLY bug reports.

### Disclaimer

Please do NOT email me or call me if you find my number/email about damage or
any trouble you get into using these programs. They ARE for LEARNING
(educational) purposes ONLY. I CANNOT be held accountable for your actions, this
little project is to show you how you can do very simple algorithms and other
small things that you may want to. But aren't sure how to implement them
yourself.
